  text: This year has been an amazing journey for us and it has been a pleasure
    being able to bring joy to as much people as possible, bringing a society
    back to life and transforming it into what it is today. To showcase our
    society, I've created this site to show our highlights and what we achieved
    over the year

      tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
      own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget to
      fall in love with in our shop.

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
